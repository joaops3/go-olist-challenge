# Overview

This project provides a REST API for streaming and processing large CSV files. Inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/olist/work-at-olist">Olist-Challenge</a> and it's using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset">Dataset</a> of movies to test upload. The API is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, allowing users to upload csv data into MongoDb.
